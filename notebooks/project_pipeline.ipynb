       " [\"Crops developed by artificial methods - such as mutation by exposure to near-lethal doses of nuclear radiation - have been consumed since the 1930's.  Today's methods  of genetic engineering do less modification to the plant than did the older methods.  And unlike what was done between 1930 and 1970, we now understand what we are doing, and what we are changing.  Over 270 independent scientific societies around the world have publicly stated that food from genetically engineered crops and animals are as safe as any other food.  Over 1700 peer-reviewed scientific papers have shown th at these foods are safe to eat.  Over twenty years of experience with genetically engineered crops, and over 40 years of experience with genetically engineered bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals in scientific research has allowed us to develop genetic engineering into one of the most extensively investigated, widely used biological tools in medicine and agriculture.We all are concerned with the environmental impact of food production, with a growing human population and decreasing amount of land.  Modern crop varieties, developed by a variety of methods including genetic engineering, are allowing us to produce more food on less land.  Today, the U.S. would require over 100 million acres additional farm land than we are now using, if we were not using modern crop varieties. Anyone who wishes to preserve any of the wild and open spaces in America for future generations should do all they can to insure that there are no barriers to the development and use of the most advanced crop varieties.Over 20% of the world’s potato crop and the world’s wheat crop is destroyed by disease.  Worldwide, oranges and other citrus crops are threatened by disease; over ½ of the Florida orange crop has been destroyed, in spite of hundreds of millions of dollars of research.  A genetic solution for these diseases exist, but Florida growers are reluctant to go forward due to the unfounded fears of some consumers. At this point, we either need to accept the scientific consensus that modern plant development techniques produce safe products, or we need to accept that the world will soon no longer have oranges, then other citrus crops. Meanwhile, efforts to control the spread of citrus disease in Florida have resulted in a very large increase in the application of toxic pesticides to the orange groves.  Bananas are a staple food for millions of people in Africa, and a favorite here in the U.S.  Like oranges, the world’s banana crop is being threatened by diseases which cannot be controlled by any existing technology or farming methods.  Although Americans don’t care, cassava is another African staple crop being threatened by disease.  As we attempt to grow more and more food in less and less space, plant diseases will continue to increase in number and intensity.  Pesticides do not control these diseases, and none of us want to see more and more chemicals applied to crops, and these are not needed when crops naturally resistant to these diseases are developed and grown.  Certain large corporations and wealthy individuals have vested financial interests in promoting the “non-GMO” and “eat only organic” themes; the fact is that there is not a single confirmed medical report of anyone ever being harmed by any modern genetically engineered food crop. The claims that any genetically engineered crop can be harmful is 100% false, and the world experience of eating hundreds of different crops produced by exposure to nuclear radiation, without any harm, shows that those claims are false.  At present, it costs about $100 million to gain government approval of a new crop variety. This situation insures that only very large multinational corporations are likely to develop new seeds. The reduction in regulatory burden will greatly improve the ability of a multitude of small NGOs,  private companies, and even individuals to develop and commercialize new plant varieties using modern genetic engineering techniques.  Many people are concerned about nutrition.  We have vast opportunities to greatly improve the nutritional content of many foods, but these are being held back by the current regulatory burden and the public concern being generated by those who stand to profit by convincing people to buy “non-GMO” and “organic”.  Why sell a tomato for $1.15 when you can sell the exact same tomato for $4.50, if you can run an advertising campaign that the cheaper product will cause cancer and birth defects?  After all, it’s just advertising, and we all know that advertising promotes corporate self-interest. \",\n",
       "  'The 1992 modifications referenced in this op ed actually \"presumed\" genetically engineered foods to be safe without the experimental data to reliably support this presumption.  Therefore, to this very day, no independent testing for human safety is required, and overwhelmingly, any safety testing that might be performed is done under the auspices of industry under no obligation to release data.  (This lack of required independent safety testing for human consumption applies to the Aqu-Advantage salmon as well.)  TThis op ed -- from an industry-sponsored organization -- besides failing to mention the health issues associated with genetically engineered foods and the toxic exposures they enable, also fails to mention the adverse environmental, economic and food security issues that have given rise to legitimate consumer concerns.   Just as genetically engineered foods are required to be clearly labeled as such in over 60 countries of the world (including European countries), these foods should be required to be labeled in the U.S. so that at least consumers could make their choice at the market.  But industry has spent a fortune preventing this as well.    '],\n",

First, I've thought ever since i was a kid that there was something wasteful about growing a tree for several years merely to chop it down, stick in my living room for a couple of weeks and then throw it away.  (Yes, we do the same thing with flowers but I grow flowers in my garden to enjoy seeing them while they are still alive. We only cut them and bring them into the house because they are about to wither and die or to encourage more blossom growth.)  Second, real trees shed needles like crazy. Third, real trees are a serious fire hazard. Fourth, it's a bit of a hassle buying  real tree every year and schlepping it home. Fifth, $50-$70 is a lot to pay for something you're just going to throw away in 2 or 3 weeks.\",\n",

The real tree grows in the ground absorbing CO2, then gets turned into mulch afterward (retaining that CO2).  The fake tree?  Do you realize how much energy goes into producing one of those plastic monstrosities?',\n",

This illustrates the complexity of effective small schools, but examples of very successful small schools, even with challenging demographics (Comer College Prep, for example) are not hard to find, even in Chicago.  If those 37 courses at Hirsh were as strong (or stronger) than comparable courses at Lane, then there’s a potential for better outcomes at Hirsh and similar schools cited in the article.Declining enrollments in failing schools is natural, if not desirable.  What parent is happy to send their kids to schools that don’t prepare them to succeed in life?  The outrage should not be about saving a building, it should be about being better stewards of our students’ futures.  A building may be perceived as the “anchor of the community” as suggeste in the article, but I would argue that the children are the anchor of a community and their success should be our only goal...',\n",

Why do so many parents work three and four jobs to pay for their kids to attend private schools when CPS is free?  Exactly why do 52 percent of students of all races not attend neighborhood schools?

Second, with the gentrification of the Southside of Chicago, the removal of affordable housing, the disinvestment in neighborhood schools and the infusion of charter schools with more funding and dismal results has every thing to do with the decline in student enrollment in Chicago\\'s neighborhood schools.

Also, the infrastructure to support it is not there at all or any time soon.  Last time I refueled, it was $2.50 per gallon.  That's not much of an incentive to switch.

      "Heavy metal pollution makes no distinction between how crops are grown. Irrespective of whether farming practices are organic or conventional practices are used, if the likes of cadmium, arsenic, lead, nickel and mercury are in the soil, water or air they can contaminate food and poison the people who consume it. With enough exposure, heavy metals can build up in the body, causing chronic problems in the skin, intestine, nervous system, kidneys, liver, and brain. Some heavy metals occur naturally in soil, but rarely at toxic levels, while human activities like mining, manufacturing and the use of synthetic materials like paint, and even some agricultural chemicals, can release heavy metals into the air and water, and from there they find their way to the soil. And once in the soil, heavy metals are virtually impossible to remove.\n",
      "China acknowledgedlast April that a staggering one-fifth of its arable land is seriously polluted with heavy metals, thanks to decades of aggressive industrial development. China’s Environmental Protection Ministry looked at data sampled between 2006 and 2013 and described the situation as “not optimistic.” The most commonly found heavy metals were cadmium, nickel and arsenic. The revelation came after months of speculation about the report, which at one point was not going to be released as the results were considered to be a “State Secret.”\n",
      "Cadmium, one of the metals found in high concentrations in Chinese soil, is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants. It moves through soil layers with ease, and is taken up by a variety of plants, including leafy vegetables, root crops, cereals and grains. Last year it was discovered that nearly half of the rice for sale in the southern China city of Guangzhou was tainted with cadmium, which caused a major uproar.\n",
      "Nickel and arsenic, the other two pollutants found in greatest amounts, aren’t so great either.\n",
      "In the U.S., arsenic in apple juice has been on the popular radar since September 2011, when Mehmet Oz reported high arsenic levels in multiple samples of apple juice that were independently tested for his television show. More than half of the apple juice consumed in the U.S. comes from China.\n",
      "Oz was taken to the woodshed for being alarmist by a number of experts and authorities, including the FDA, which disputed the results with its own data. ABC News’ senior health medical editor, Richard Besser, called Oz’s claims “extremely irresponsible,” comparing it to yelling fire in a crowded theater.\n",
      "A few weeks later, FDA admitted it had withheld many test results which did, in fact, support Oz’s claim. Besser apologizedto Oz on national television, and soon after the FDA collected about 90 retail samples of apple juice for a new round of analysis. According to FDA documents now available, the levels reported by Oz are in fact consistent with those detected by the agency in samples from China and Turkey.\n",
      "Last year the agency set a limit, also known as an “action level,” on arsenic in juice, at 10 parts per billion, the same level that’s enforced in drinking water. Currently, FDA has import alerts set for four firms, two each in China and Turkey. The products of these companies, while regularly tested for arsenic because of previous violations of the action level, continue to be imported.\n",
      "While China is not the only polluted region from which we import food, with a combination of aggressive industrial development and legendarily lax enforcement, it’s become a poster child for scary food imports. But any region with rapid industrial development and suspect environmental regulations could be a candidate for producing food contaminated with heavy metals.\n",
      "While we don’t import a huge amount of food from China overall, we do consume large amounts of certain things in addition to apple juice, like garlic and farmed seafood—including 80 percent of the tilapia we eat. Much of China’s surface water, including water used for aquaculture, is polluted, not only with industrial toxins but also with agricultural fertilizers, which fuel the growth of algae. Algae can accumulate heavy metals, as will the fish that eat it.\n",
      "“Foods offered for import into the U.S. are required to meet the same U.S. food safety standards as domestic products,” explained FDA spokesperson Lauren Sucher, via email. “If the FDA encounters information that indicates that a particular product could pose a public health concern, the FDA can target that product for increased testing.”\n",
      "When asked if the revelation that 20 percent of China’s farmland is polluted with heavy metals would spur increased testing on Chinese imports, Sucher replied, “The FDA doesn't announce its actions in advance. If our surveillance sampling indicated a problem with a particular commodity, the agency would take steps to protect the public.”\n",
      "Wary consumers who aren’t interested in waiting for FDA to ramp up its testing of Chinese food imports can take their own measures to minimize the possibility of contamination. Local, as in American-grown produce, will trump labels such as “organic,” if the food in question was grown in a potentially polluted place.\n",
      "In fact, if it’s grown in a polluted place, organic produce could contain more heavy metals than conventionally grown food. Organic agriculture practices include the use of manure, which could add heavy metals to the soil if the cattle were eating contaminated feed, such as hay grown in a contaminated field, according to Michael Schmitt, a soil scientist at the University of Minnesota. “Once you put metals in a field,” he said, “they don’t go away.”\n",
      "Thus, organic food from a polluted area of China could carry significantly more heavy metals than nonorganic food from the U.S. This puts a new spin on the idea of eating locally. In this case it could mean from anywhere in this vast continent—Canada and Mexico don’t seem to have heavy metal problems. But in a way, the reasons are similar to why many people prefer buying from the local farm stand: you have more information about how something is grown.\n",
      "Not all food is required by law to be labeled with a country of origin. Foods purchased abroad and processed in the U.S., for example, are exempt, as are foods containing multiple ingredients. The safest way to confirm a food item didn’t come from China is to look for labels that announce where it is from. If no information is given, avoid it.\n",
      "Dietary supplements can pose even more of a risk of heavy metal contamination than food because they are so highly concentrated. If the materials from which they are made are contaminated, the contaminants will be concentrated. In 2010 the New York Times reportedthat many supplement manufacturers have set up shop in China in recent years, and that Chinese supplement factories are notoriously under-regulated.\n",
      "FDA does not test supplements. Rather, it sets up guidelines and leaves the testing to the manufacturers. This self-policing is notoriously inadequate. According to testimony given to a congressional committee by Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, about one in four supplements his lab tested had issues. The two most common problems were lack of the appropriate quantities of the ingredients indicated on the label, and presence of excessive heavy metals.\n",
      "Michael Pollan and others have advised keeping your diet simple, using locally grown, minimally processed food, and getting most of your nutrition from whole plants rather than supplements. Pollan may not have been thinking about heavy metals when he penned that guidance, but given what we are learning today, it makes his advice all the more worth following.\n",

In some cases, companies such as Kellogg's, Quaker Oats (PepsiCo), Barbara’s Bakery and Whole Foods Market are selling products contaminated with toxic agrichemicals and Monsanto's genetically engineered organisms while promoting them as \"natural.\" The new report, Cereal Crimes: How “Natural” Claims Deceive Consumers and Undermine the Organic Label—A Look Down the Cereal and Granola Aisle (available at http://app.streamsend.com/c/14825543/3130/hM5ZJGf/9pOA?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornucopia.org) explores this growing trend of marketing conventional foods as “natural” to lure health-conscious and eco-conscious consumers and their shopping dollars. Unlike the organic label, no government agency, certification group, or other independent entity defines the term “natural” on processed food packages or ensures that the claim has merit. In contrast, breakfast cereals displaying the USDA's \"certified organic\" logo are produced under a strict set of verified standards prohibiting the use of petrochemical-based fertilizers, sewage sludge, synthetic toxic pesticides, genetically modified crops, and many other common conventional agricultural and manufacturing inputs. Cereal Crimes details how prominent agribusinesses are increasingly using various strategies to create the illusion of equivalence between the “natural” and organic labels to mislead consumers. “Some companies that started out organic, and built brand loyalty as organic brands, have switched to non-organic ingredients and “natural” labeling,” said Charlotte Vallaeys, Director of Farm and Food Policy at Cornucopia. One such brand, Peace Cereal® is an example of what Cornucopia calls “bait-and-switch.” In 2008, the Peace Cereal® brand switched from organic to cheaper conventional ingredients, without lowering its prices. Today, the cereal is sold in natural food stores and mainstream grocers at prices above many of their certified organic competitors that are using more expensive organic ingredients. Although the prices may be similar, in reality, there is a vast difference between organic and “natural” products from grain produced with the use of toxic pesticides. In some cases, companies charge high prices for “natural” products that even contain genetically engineered crops developed by St. Louis-based Monsanto. Pesticides that are strictly prohibited in organics are commonly used to produce ingredients for “natural” products. For example, organophosphate pesticides were developed from World War II-era nerve gas and are designed to be toxic to the neurological systems of target organisms. They are deadly to insects but also have been proven damaging to humans—with fetusesi and children especially at risk. Several recent studies have linked organophosphate pesticide exposure to a wide range of developmental disorders in children, including behavioral problems, poorer short-term memory and motor skills, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).ii, iii, iv, v While federal law prohibits organic farmers from using these toxic pesticides, no such restriction exists for “natural” products. \"This is exactly why parents are seeking out truly natural (organic) products for their children and are deceived by corporate agribusinesses and their Madison Avenue agencies,\" said Vallaeys. USDA testing has found residues of organophosphate pesticides like chlorpyrifos and malathion on corn, soy, wheat flour, and oats, which are all common ingredients in breakfast cereals. In the case of wheat flour, residues were found in more than 60% of samples. Given increasing consumer interest in avoiding genetically engineered (GE) ingredients, The Cornucopia Institute contracted with an independent, accredited laboratory to test many “natural” breakfast cereals for potential genetic contamination. \"Natural\" cereals from brands including Kashi (Kellogg's), Mother’s (PepsiCo), Nutritious Living, Barbara’s Bakery (Weetabix), and 365 (Whole Foods Market) contained high levels of genetically engineered ingredients (between 25%, and 100%)—even though a number of these companies are represented as \"non-GMO\" to the public. To help health-conscious consumers make informed grocery purchases, Cereal Crimes is accompanied by a scorecard rating various breakfast cereal and granola brands for the true support of healthy and environmentally sustainable practices. The scorecard can also be viewed on Cornucopia's website. “Consumers probably find this marketplace subterfuge less surprising when they learn that many of the leading ‘natural’ cereal brands are really manufactured by giant agribusinesses like Kellogg's, hiding behind the façade of well-established niche brands,” said Harry Bennett, a marketing official with the Kansas Organic Producers Association, a cooperative marketing organic grain. Despite finding that “natural” cereal products offer few, if any, advantages over conventional products, companies typically charge substantially higher prices for products with “natural” labeling claims. Analysis by Cornucopia of wholesale and retail cereal and granola prices revealed that “natural” products often are priced higher than equivalent organic products. This suggests that some companies are profiting from consumer confusion. For example, prices in the leading natural/organic food distributor’s wholesale catalog for multigrain flakes show that two of the least expensive products are actually certified organic, offered by industry leader Nature’s Path and Food for Life. Meanwhile, Kashi’s 7-grain cereal, made with cheaper non-organic grains by the multinational corporation Kellogg but disguised as an independent sounding “natural” brand, is priced higher than equivalent organic options. Karen Zwicky of Minneapolis, MN said she just bought several boxes of Kashi cereal for her 2 year old daughter, who she's been feeding a \"pretty\" strict organic diet. \"Target was handing out samples of Kashi, and she loved the taste and I trusted the brand, even though it isn't labeled as organic,\" Zwicky explained. \"I don't mind that the big brands buy out the smaller organic and more sustainable companies, what really is disturbing to me is that it seems that they are only doing so in order to buy consumer trust.\" \"Committed organic companies, rated highly in Cornucopia’s online scorecard, must compete against giant multinationals such as Kraft Foods (Back to Nature), Pepsico (Mother’s) and Kellogg’s (Bear Naked /Kashi) and misleading “natural” marketing claims,” stated Mark A. Kastel, Codirector at the Wisconsin-based Cornucopia Institute. \"When marketers intentionally mislead consumers with their “natural” products, they are taking business away from the companies providing truly safe and healthy food and supporting certified organic farmers.\" -30- MORE: Become an expert in 4 min.

According to research by the Natural Marketing Institute, a market research firm, two-thirds of U.S. consumers believe foods today are less safe to eat because of chemicals used during the growing and processing of foods. Given this widespread interest in avoiding foodborne chemicals, it is increasingly important for consumers to realize that buying \"natural\" foods does little, if anything, to avoid synthetic inputs and toxins used on the farms and inside the manufacturing plants. \"While calling their products natural, some of the largest breakfast cereal manufacturers are adding ingredients processed with the neurotoxic solvent hexane, a processing agent that is banned in organic food production,\" added Kastel. Genetically Engineered Ingredients in \"Natural\" Food The Cornucopia Institute sent samples of “natural” breakfast cereal to an accredited GMO testing laboratory. Out of nine samples of “natural” breakfast cereal that yielded results, six (a full two thirds), contained high levels of genetically engineered corn or soy, including such major brands as Kashi, Barbara's and Whole Foods'365 label. “This was not incidental contamination,” says Kastel. “Levels of GMOs were between 28% and 100%, showing that these manufacturers purchased GMO ingredients for their so-called natural cereal products.” Some of the brands and products that tested positive for high levels of GMOs are enrolled in the Non-GMO Project, and as a result, are listed as good choices in some online non-GMO shopping guides.vi For example, the Non-GMO Shopping Guide includes brands such as Kashi, Whole Foods Market’s 365 Everyday Value and Barbara’s Bakery, which all tested positive for GMOs. One hundred percent (100%) of the soybeans used in Kashi’s GoLean cereal was shown to be genetically engineered. Specific products like Barbara’s Bakery’s Puffins and 365 Corn Flakes are listed in the Non-GMO Shopping Guide – yet they contained 55% and 57% GMO corn, respectively. Neurotoxic Solvents (Hexane) Used to Process \"Natural\" Food Ingredients Hexane is a solvent commonly used to separate the oil, fiber and protein from grains and seeds. Some granola and cereal manufacturers use soy ingredients, such as soy grits and soy protein isolate, which are commonly hexane-extracted and can contain residues. Past testing by The Cornucopia Institute has shown hexane residues in some \"natural\" food ingredients. In addition to being toxic to humans, hexane is a dangerous chemical to both the environment and workers who have to handle the material. A number of hexane-related fires and explosions have caused injuries and deaths in food manufacturing plants. Debra Boschee, an astute consumer from Rapid City, South Dakota, said \"It isn't the things we know that scare us, it's the things we don't know, such as 'what's really in my food.'\" In addition to accessing The Cornucopia Institute's new scorecard, comparing the nation's natural and organic cereal brands, families who are interested in feeding their families the safest and most nutritional food can also find the ratings of over 120 organic dairy brands, to augment a healthy breakfast, on the Cornucopia website: http://app.streamsend.com/c/14825543/3134/hM5ZJGf/9pOA?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornucopia.org The Cornucopia Institute is dedicated to the fight for economic justice for the family-scale farming community.

      "I went to the store the other day and took a nostalgic walk down the baby isle and happened upon the formula. I was shocked how expensive it was. 23$ a can! That seems like such an outrageous price to pay for something baby has to have to live. My mil told me when she was FF in the early 90's, formula was only 6$ a can. Much more reasonable. But to be honest, all of the women I know who do FF, use Wic. So that got me wondering, is giving away so much free formula (WIC participants consume roughly 54% of all formula sold in the United States) the reason why it's so expensive?\n",
      "Here's an article I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally set to help low-income families, currently about 45 percent of all families receive WIC payments. Here we go: So about 50 percent of Americans are helping to support the other 50 percent!\n",
      "\n",
      "Remarkably, the WIC program accounts for about half of all infant formula sold in the nation. The program was supposed to be only for low-income families, yet it now provides free formula for many middle-income families that certainly don’t need government subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "An even more troubling aspect of WIC is that it encourages parents to feed their babies infant formula rather than breast milk. The share of mothers on WIC who are breastfeeding is substantially lower than that of mothers not using WIC. That effect runs directly counter to the universal advice of health care experts regarding the superiority of breast milk for child development. The WIC program results in low-income parents substituting less nutritious formula for more nutritious mother’s milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another troubling aspect of WIC is that the program’s large subsidies for infant formula appear to be driving up the retail price. The price of formula has risen rapidly since the early 1980s as WIC enrollment has increased. Because recipients are not sensitive to the pricing of WIC food items such as formula, stores can raise prices and receive larger cash redemptions from state agencies\n",
      "The WIC program drives up the cost of formula for families not on the program as well, and some portion of the taxpayer subsidies for WIC ends up going to the makers of infant formula. This “leakage” of benefits is a common problem in subsidy programs. It is thought, for example, that rising government subsidies for college education have helped spur the rapid inflation in college tuition costs.\n",

      "Posted: 05/02/2012 10:56 am EDT\n",
      "If you thought finding a fly in your soup was enough to turn you off your meal, try finding a maggot in your canned mushrooms or caterpillar remains in your spinach salad. Just about everyone has heard a horror story when it comes to food and insects, and part of that might be thanks to relaxed policies when it comes creepy crawlers and governmental food agencies.\n",
      "In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the body overseeing the protection of public health by assuring the safety and security of food consumed in America. However, due to what's described as by Organic Gardening as \"a lax food-safety loophole,\" the FDA permits a certain degree of insects, such as worms or aphids, so long as their presence doesn't compromise the aesthetic quality of the food.\n",
      "The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has some rules about labels when it comes to bugs and food with which produce can be sold. For example, for cabbage, 10 aphids on a head can still equal a no.1 grading during inspection, but any presence of worms on an edible portion of the head bumps a crop down to a no.2 grading.\n",
      "Here's a compilation of the eight bugs you might be unintentionally eating according to the FDA's \"The Food Defect Action Levels: Levels of natural or unavoidable defects in foods that present no health hazards for humans\" guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you thought aphids were only a threat to your tulips and roses, think again. The number of whole aphids that the FDA deems permissible varies from vegetable to vegetable. On the low end, you can expect about 30 whole aphids/100 grams in Brussels sprouts and about 60 of the little buggers in frozen broccoli.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also known as thunderblights or corn lice, thrips are winged pests and are about a millimetre in length. They feed by sucking out the nutrients in the vegetables you'd find in a frozen vegetable mixture. You can expect to find no more than 50 of them in every 100 grams of canned or frozen spinach or in a package of sauerkraut.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a good chance that you'll be able to spot if your food is laced with velvet mites since they're bright red (see photo), but you might have trouble with their cousin, the white mite. The white mite can often be found in grains, but has also been known to make its way into frozen vegetables too. Expect to find no more than 75 of them in your canned mushrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you're a Casu marzu connoisseur, the thought of maggots in your food is enough to make you throw up. If so, you'd best pass up canned mushrooms, which allow 20 maggots for every 100 grams of drained mushrooms, according to FDA standards.\n",

      "There's a good chance you've seen a fruit fly before, buzzing around a fruit basket or a wine glass left out too long. There's also a good chance that you've been ingesting these flies with your fruit juice, since there's about five flies in every 1 cup of juice.\n",

      "If you've ever wanted a reason to buy dried black-eyed peas instead of the canned variety, thank the Cowpea curculio. It's a type of larva that eventually grows into a small brown weevil, and there's about five of them in every can of peas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You'd think it would be hard to miss out on something like a caterpillar in your food, but just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't there. Such is the case with spinach, which can be dotted with caterpillar larvae and larval fragments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time you're shucking corn, keep an eye out for the corn ear worm, which fortunately doesn't go for the kernel, but rather, the silk in the husk. You'll also want to double-check canned corn since these worms tend to leave traces of their skin and larvae where ever they go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In some countries, the consumption of insects is a common practice, since they're an excellent source of affordable protein. However, many people aren't quite ready for dinning on mealworms sautéed in a marinara sauce or flies instead of french fries. Back in 2008, Vancouver's Vij's, recently rated Canada's best restaurant by Vacay.ca, made headlines for offering cricket paratha . The crickets were ground and used as flour for the paratha, an Indian flatbread. Most recently, Starbucks announced that they would stop using a dye made out of ground-up beetles for their drinks.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hundreds of years ago people didn’t have to worry about toxicity in the body. They used a simplistic and natural way of life that didn’t require detoxification of toxins. It wasn’t until just recently that medical professionals began to acknowledge the issue of chemicals polluting our bodies.\n",
      "We all know the saying “You are what you eat…” But how can we be sure what we are if we don’t know much about what we eat? Nourishing yourself with seemingly everyday foods seems like a perfectly safe venture right?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that toxins have become an inescapable part of our everyday lives. In the previous decade there have been roughly 100,000 different chemicals used in the United States. They’re used commercially in the food we eat, the medicine we take, and general house care products that appear completely innocent.\n",
      "Studies by the Environmental Working Group recently discovered that even unborn babies can’t avoid pollution in our toxin-laden society. They found traces of more than 200 commercial chemicals within the umbilical cords before birth. You might not be able to avoid the toxins but knowing where they come from and how to treat them will help reduce the impact of toxicity significantly.\n",
      "Signs that You Have Too Many Toxins in Your Body\n",
      "So at this point we know how prevalent toxins are in our society. What we haven’t covered is how to tell whether or not the amount of toxins is effecting your overall health in a negative way. Listed below are a few of the most common signs of too much toxin exposure.\n",
      "Sleep disorders like insomnia and restlessness\n",
      "Body odor and foul breath\n",
      "Persisting exhaustion\n",
      "Worsening inflammatory problems like arthritis and asthma\n",
      "Trouble with digestion\n",
      "Development of ulcers or hemorrhoids\n",
      "Increase in acne, psoriasis, eczema, and other skin conditions\n",
      "Loss of mental clarity and motivation\n",
      "Muscle and joint pain\n",
      "Worsened PMS symptoms\n",
      "Congestion\n",
      "It’s worth noting that these signs are quite general. Some might be a symptom of a completely irrelevant medical condition. Before you go assuming that your body is polluted you should always check up with your physician.\n",
      "This is a factor that goes both ways however. Some physicians might have trouble assigning a source to symptoms caused by body toxicity. They may also attribute the symptoms to something that isn’t actually affecting you. This pitfall exists because many medical practitioners aren’t required to be well-versed in body toxicity knowledge.\n",
      "There are also many diseases that can be worsened with body toxicity. Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, depression, cancer, fibromyalgia, and heart disease are all catalyzed with the introduction of toxins.\n",
      "It’s always better to be safe than sorry and take steps to enhance detoxification. The strongest weapon in the fight against body toxicity is knowledge. Reducing your exposure to toxins and practicing detoxification can only encourage a healthier and happier lifestyle.\n",
      "Major Sources of Toxins\n",
      "The first toxin source you should be weary of is food. This plays a huge role in detoxing your body because it is the most direct intake of industrial chemicals. Processed foods are the most common source of additives and chemicals and should be avoided when possible. Pesticides sprinkled on to crops can also add foreign toxins to your body. You can also read my other post about the most pesticide ridden fruit and vegetables.\n",
      "Another deceiving source of toxins is within personal care products. Chemicals are abundant in a lot of the shampoo, body wash, soap, lotion, toothpaste, skin cream, and deodorant that we use so casually on a daily basis. If you want to avoid these toxins you can make your own natural healthcare products.\n",
      "The third major contributor of toxin intake is environmental factors. Inside of your home there could be chemicals lingering from the use of cleaning products and a lack of air circulation. Outside of your home there are plenty of pollutants from secondhand smoke, vehicles, and the production of commercial goods. You can read my other post on how to make your own natural household cleaner.\n",
      "Keep in mind that these are just the three major contributors to toxicity within your body. There are plenty of other small ways that toxins can sneak into your routine. Always exercise caution when purchasing products and carefully examine the areas that you live in.\n",
      "Easy Steps for Optimal Detoxification\n",
      "1. Reduce Exposure – The first and most obvious step to take is modifying your routine to reduce your exposure to the chemicals. Analyze the sources listed above and try to minimize the pollution you encounter throughout the day. You can start by avoiding these most toxic food ingredients and avoiding these fake foods.\n",
      "2. Stay Hydrated – Water is an essential tool for your body to flush out the chemicals you are exposed to. Purchase a filter to make sure your water is pure and make sure you drink it in regular intervals. A minimum of 8-10 cups of water per day is recommended.\n",
      "3. Go Organic – Switch up that shopping list and ditch the processed foods. Look for organic sources of fruit and vegetables and try to avoid retailers that mass produce it. This will decrease the presence of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are used for commercial gain. Green vegetables and most fruits have effective detoxifying qualities. You can find more information in my article about how to detoxify your body using chlorophyll and how to detox your body with these 8 leafy greens.\n",
      "4. Maintain Healthy Digestion – Get the right amount of fiber in your diet and make sure that you use the bathroom regularly. The average person should move their bowels 1-2 times each day to prevent toxin buildup. You can make you owndigestive detox smoothie.\n",
      "5. Exercise – Getting active will fire up your circulation and turn your body into a toxin flushing machine. Going for runs, swimming, playing sports, or simply getting out to walk around once in a while will help keep you in shape and away from body toxicity.\n",
      "6. Supplementation – There are health supplements out there that will help you reduce toxicity within your body. For example: spirulina and chlorella are two kinds of blue-green algae that are effective at binding and removing toxins from your body, and they work well for detoxing from heavy metal exposure. You can get more information in my article on how to boost your health by eating seaweeds and algae. If you have been exposed to a large amount of toxins and want a quick fix, some recommend taking activated charcoal. Always check with your doctor before taking any supplements.\n",
      "You can a lot more information about the most effective natural methods to detox your body in my e-book The Detox Guide. This guide will teach you how to use detox to cleanse and energize your body naturally and safely.\n",
      "Many people are shocked to learn that the environment isn’t the only thing we’re polluting. Our own bodies suffer as well. With these steps in mind you can lead a lifestyle free of body toxicity. You’ll feel better and ensure a healthier future once you’ve taken the step towards a natural life and cleared your body of toxins.\n",

      "When I was on FS, I ran into the same problems. But I ran into a solution that I had never considered before ( no it wasn't get a job, because I already had one of those) No, it was alternatives! I learned a way to get around the whole system. I thought, If I can't buy necessities like soap and cleaners on the FS card, I wonder if there are \"food\" items that I could use! And there was! Now I know some of you already know this, but you will be surprised with how many people do not know this. Or maybe they have heard of it before and just plain forgot.

But being on the kind of budget I was on ( I had no more than 5-15 dollars to spend on cleaners out of pocket) and spending 3-5 dollars for everything, that wasn't going to cut it. Even buying off brand or store brand household items were too expensive. So! I did what I had to do.\n",
      "First! I looked up recipes. And I found that the majority of the cleaners and personal items were made up of things that I could buy with my FS card! Things like baking soda, white vinegar, lemon juice, and alum even! And the other things, like rubbing alcohol and peroxide, I found at the nearest one dollar store ( or sometimes in the clearance bin at the grocery store for less than a buck)! There were a few items where I had to pay a little bit more than a dollar for, but it stretched. Things like borax and washing soda.. I believe the borax was under $5 and the washing soda was under $4.\n",

The coconut oil can usually be found in the organic section of your grocer or in with the other cooking oils. Grind up the oats with a blender or coffee maker. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Keep mixing until it has formed into a paste. When you have finished, massage it onto the wet skin for a deep, moisturizing cleanse. Triple the ingredients if more than one person will use this or if you need a good body treatment. For the body treatment, massage the mixture all over the body and leave on for a few minutes. Then, rinse gently. The body will feel smooth. Refrigerate any leftover portions. It can last up to 1 week in the refrigerator.

      "Deodorant\n",
      "There are a few different options for deodorant. You can either use baking soda and alum (found in the spice aisle) or rubbing alcohol. The rubbing alcohol of course is not a food stamp option, but can be found for 50 cents or less when on on sale. To make the baking soda/alum kind, just mix about 1 teaspoon of alum with about 4 teaspoons of baking soda. Keep it in a dry, cool place. Dab it with a wet cloth and spread it on your underarms. It should last 24 hours. For the first couple days, you may need to use it more than once, but then after that, it will last quite a while. The rubbing alcohol can just be dabbed onto the underarms each morning. As with the baking soda/alum, the first couple of days may require more than one application. To make it even more effective and easier to spread, here is a recipe that uses all three. All you do is add 4 teaspoons of alum to 2 teaspoons of baking soda and sift it together with a fork. Then, pour in 8 ounces of rubbing alcohol and mix it together. It may bubble over, so I recommend using a large bowl and adding the alcohol slowly. Once it has been mixed, it won't bubble again. Just pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray on your underarms or even all over the body if you get hot easy. Adding a couple teaspoons of pure vanilla or almond extract can scent it well and make for a great body spray mist or perfume. Try experimenting with different baking extracts and candy flavorings for a variety of scents.\n",

      "\n",
      "High hippuric acid (Marker 14) may derive from food, GI bacterial activity, or exposure to the solvent toluene . Hippuric acid is a conjugate of glycine and benzoic acid formed in the liver. Most hippuric acid in urine is derived from microbial breakdown of chlorogenic acid to benzoic acid. Chlorogenic acid is a common substance in beverages and in many fruits and vegetables, including apples, pears, tea, coffee, sunflower seeds, carrots, blueberries, cherries, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, sweet potatoes, and peaches. Benzoic acid is present in high amounts in cranberry juice and is a food preservative. The workplace is the most common source of toluene exposure, but toluene may be absorbed from outgassing of new carpets and other building materials, or absorbed during recreational abuse of solvents such as gluesniffing. Because most hippuric acid in urine is from GI sources, this marker is a poor indicator of toluene exposure and is being replaced by other markers in occupational safety testing. Bacterial overgrowth can be treated with natural antibacterial agents and/or probiotics (30-50 billion cfu’s) that include Lactobacillus rhamnosus.\n",
      "\n",
      "High succinic acid (Markers 16, 26) may indicate a relative deficiency of riboflavin and/or coenzyme Q10 (cofactors for succinic dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle). Supplementation with a minimum of 20 mg riboflavin (which could be provided through a high quality multivitamin) and/or 50 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 is recommended. Clinical observation suggests that succinic acid levels also decrease after treatment for GI dysbiosis.\n",

      "High 4-cresol (p-cresol) (Marker 18) commonly results from metabolism of certain aromatic amino acids by Clostridia species, C. difficile and C.scatologenes, in the gastrointestinal tract. Other common Clostridia species and other bacteria species do not produce this metabolite. 4-Cresol is also a metabolite of toluene, of menthofuran (from the mint family plant pennyroyal) and of wood tar creosote. The major clinical significance of 4-cresol is that it is a potent inhibitor of brain dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine. High concentrations of this compound may cause psychotic behavior by inhibiting metabolism of dopamine to norepinephrine,\n",
      "resulting in high levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) in the urine and insufficient norepinephrine in the central nervous system. High urine values of 4-cresol have been associated with the most severe clinical\n",
      "symptoms in autism. High values have also been associated with multiple sclerosis. The neurotoxicity and hallucinations associated with pennyroyal ingestion may be due to the toxicity of the 4-cresol metabolite.\n",
      "\n",
      "High oxalic with or without elevated glyceric or glycolic acids (Markers 20,21,22) may be associated with the genetic hyperoxalurias, autism, women with vulvar pain, fibromyalgia, and may also be due to high vitamin C intake.\n",
      "However, kidney stone formation from oxalic acid was not correlated with vitamin C intake in a very large study . Besides being present in varying concentrations in most vegetables and fruits, oxalates, the mineral conjugate base forms of oxalic acid, are also byproducts of molds such as Aspergillus and Penicillium and probably Candida. If yeast or fungal markers are elevated, antifungal therapy may reduce excess oxalates. High oxalates may cause anemia that is difficult to treat, skin ulcers, muscles pains, and heart abnormalities . Elevated oxalic acid is also the result of anti-freeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning. Oxalic acid is a toxic metabolite of trichloroacetic acid and other environmental pollutants. In addition, decomposing vitamin C may form oxalates during transport or storage. Elevated oxalate values with a concomitant increase in glycolic acid may indicate genetic hyperoxaluria (type I), whereas increased glyceric acid may indicate a genetic hyperoxaluria (type II). Elevated oxalic acid with normal levels of glyceric or glycolic metabolites rules out a genetic cause for high oxalate. However, elevated oxalates may be due to a new\n",
      "genetic disorder, hyperoxaluria type III. Regardless of its source, high oxalic acid may contribute to kidney stones and may also reduce ionized calcium. Oxalic acid absorption from the GI tract may be reduced by calcium citrate supplementation before meals. Vitamin B6, arginine, vitamin E, chondroitin sulfate, taurine, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids and/or N-acetyl glucosamine supplements may also reduce oxalates and/or their toxicity. Excessive fats in the diet may cause elevated oxalate if fatty acids are poorly absorbed because of bile salt deficiency. Unabsorbed free fatty acids bind calcium to form insoluble soaps, reducing calcium's ability to bind oxalate and increase its absorption. If taurine is low in a plasma amino acid profile, supplementation with taurine (1000 mg/day) may help stimulate bile salt production (taurocholic acid), leading to better fatty acid absorption and diminished oxalate absorption.\n",
      "High levels of oxalates are common in autism. Malabsorption of fat and intestinal Candida overgrowth are probably the major causes for elevated oxalates in this disorder. Even individuals with elevated glyceric or glycolic acids may not have a genetic disease. To rule out genetic diseases in those people with abnormally high markers characteristic of the genetic diseases, do the following steps: (1) Follow the nutritional steps indicated in this interpretation for one month; (2) If Candida is present, treat Candida for at least one month; (3) Repeat the organic acid test after abstaining from vitamin C supplements for 48 hours; (4) If the biochemical markers characteristic of genetic oxalate disorders are still elevated in the repeat test, consider DNA tests for the most common mutations of oxalate metabolism . DNA testing for type I hyperoxaluria is available from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN as test #89915 \"AGXT Gene, Full Gene Analysis\" and, for the p.Gly170Arg mutation only, as # 83643 \"Alanine:Glyoxylate Aminotransferase [AGXT] Mutation Analysis [G170R], Blood\"). Another option to confirm the genetic disease is a plasma oxalate test, also available from the Mayo Clinic (Phone 507.266.5700). Plasma oxalate values greater than 50 micromol/L are consistent with genetic oxalate diseases and may serve as an alternate confirmation test. Bone tends to be the major repository of excess oxalate in patients with primary hyperoxaluria. Bone oxalate levels are negligible in healthy subjects. Oxalate deposition in the skeleton tends to increase bone resorption and decrease osteoblast activity.\n",
      "Oxalates may also be deposited in the kidneys, joints, eyes, muscles, blood vessels, brain, and heart and may contribute to muscle pain in fibromyalgia. Oxalate crystal formation in the eyes may be a source of severe eye pain in individuals with autism who may exhibit eye-poking behaviors. High oxalates in the GI tract also may significantly reduce absorption\n",
      "of essential minerals such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, and others.\n",
      "A low oxalate diet may also be particularly useful in the reduction of body oxalates even if dysbiosis of GI flora is the major source of oxalates. Foods especially high in oxalates include spinach, beets, chocolate, soy, peanuts, wheat bran, tea, cashews, pecans, almonds, berries, and many others.

      "testing (blood or hair) might be useful to determine if such exposure is significant. Vanylmandelic acid (VMA), a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine, is often elevated due to stress-induced catecholamine output from the adrenal gland which depletes vitamin C. Supplementation with vitamin C (ascorbate) may be helpful in such cases. Elevated VMA may also result from the intake of L-DOPA, dopamine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine . If values are more than double the upper limit of normal, the possibility of catecholamine-secreting tumors can be ruled out by 24-hour VMA and/or HVA testing in urine. Even in this subgroup, the incidence of tumors is extremely rare.\n",

      "How 4 Mexican Immigrant Kids and Their Cheap Robot Beat MIT\n",
      "By Joshua Davis\n",
      "6:30 am |\n",
      "Permalink\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor’s note: Ten years ago, WIRED contributing editor Joshua Davis wrote a story about four high school students in Phoenix, Arizona—three of them undocumented immigrants from Mexico—beating MIT in an underwater robot competition. That story, La Vida Robot, has a new chapter: Spare Parts, starring George Lopez and Carlos PenaVega, opens in January, and Davis is publishing a book by the same title updating the kids’ story. To mark that occasion, WIRED is republishing his original story.\n",
      "The winter rain makes a mess of West Phoenix. It turns dirt yards into mud and forms reefs of garbage in the streets. Junk food wrappers, diapers, and Spanish-language porn are swept into the gutters. On West Roosevelt Avenue, security guards, two squad cars, and a handful of cops watch teenagers file into the local high school. A sign reads: Carl Hayden Community High School: The Pride’s Inside.\n",
      "There certainly isn’t a lot of pride on the outside. The school buildings are mostly drab, late ’50s-era boxes. The front lawn is nothing but brown scrub and patches of dirt. The class photos beside the principal’s office tell the story of the past four decades. In 1965, the students were nearly all white, wearing blazers, ties, and long skirts. Now the school is 92 percent Hispanic. Drooping, baggy jeans and XXXL hoodies are the norm.\n",
      "The school PA system crackles, and an upbeat female voice fills the bustling linoleum-lined hallways. “Anger management class will begin in five minutes,” says the voice from the administration building. “All referrals must report immediately.”\n",
      "Across campus, in a second-floor windowless room, four students huddle around an odd, 3-foot-tall frame constructed of PVC pipe. They have equipped it with propellers, cameras, lights, a laser, depth detectors, pumps, an underwater microphone, and an articulated pincer. At the top sits a black, waterproof briefcase containing a nest of hacked processors, minuscule fans, and LEDs. It’s a cheap but astoundingly functional underwater robot capable of recording sonar pings and retrieving objects 50 feet below the surface. The four teenagers who built it are all undocumented Mexican immigrants who came to this country through tunnels or hidden in the backseats of cars. They live in sheds and rooms without electricity. But over three days last summer, these kids from the desert proved they are among the smartest young underwater engineers in the country.\n",
      "‘What’s a PWM Cable?’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the end of June. Lorenzo Santillan, 16, sat in the front seat of the school van and looked out at the migrant farmworkers in the fields along Interstate 10. Lorenzo’s face still had its baby fat, but he’d recently sprouted a mustache and had taken to wearing a fistful of gold rings, a gold chain, and a gold medallion of the Virgin Mary pierced through the upper part of his left ear. The bling wasn’t fooling anyone. His mother had been fired from her job as a hotel maid, and his father had trouble paying the rent as a gardener. They were on the verge of eviction for nonpayment of rent. He could see himself having to quit school to work in those fields.\n",
      "“What’s a PWM cable?” The sharp question from the van’s driver, Allan Cameron, snapped Lorenzo out of his reverie. Cameron was the computer science teacher sponsoring Carl Hayden’s robotics program. At 59, he had a neatly trimmed white beard, unkempt brown hair, and more energy than most men half his age. Together with his fellow science teacher Fredi Lajvardi, Cameron had put up flyers around the school a few months earlier, offering to sponsor anyone interested in competing in the third annual Marine Advanced Technology Education Center’s Remotely Operated Vehicle Competition. Lorenzo was one of the first to show up to the after-school meeting last spring.\n",
      "Cameron hadn’t expected many students to be interested, particularly not a kid like Lorenzo, who was failing most of his classes and perpetually looked like he was about to fall asleep. But Lorenzo didn’t have much else to do after school. He didn’t want to walk around the streets. He had tried that—he’d been a member of WBP 8th Street, a westside gang. When his friends started to get arrested for theft, he dropped out. He didn’t want to go to jail.\n",
      "That’s why he decided to come to Cameron’s meeting.\n",
      "“PWM,” Lorenzo replied automatically from the van’s passenger seat. “Pulse width modulation. Esto controls analog circuits with digital output.”\n",
      "Over the past four months, Lorenzo had flourished, learning a new set of acronyms and raising his math grade from an F to an A. He had grown up rebuilding car engines with his brother and cousin. Now he was ready to build something of his own. The team had found its mechanics man.\n",

If not then either douche or use rephresh or replens to lower pH. If you are not doing TBM then you may insert 1-3 ml of lime douche 5 minutes or so after bd. Then 1/2 hour after attempt you need to check pH again. If it is high you need to lower it back down to 4-4.5. Check your pH every 1/2 hour up to 4 hours.

      "One of the biggest fears women have about giving birth is this: How will my baby fit through my hoo-ha? It's an understandable concern. \"Vaginal tearing is very common during vaginal birth,\" says Fahimeh Sasan, MD, an OB/GYN in New Yorkand assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n",
      "In fact, approximately 75 percent of women will experience vaginal tearing, also called perineal tearing, during their first vaginal delivery (second births are generally easier for the obvious reason that the area's been stretched out before).\n",
      "Sadly, in some cases vaginal tearing can't be avoided. But there are ways to lower those odds. Consider these tips to get your baby out with minimal damage:\n",
      "Adjust your position. Lying on your back can increase the odds of vaginal tearing due to plain old gravity, which puts the added weight of your baby's head right on the perineum (that's the area between your vagina and your anus). To ease this pressure, lie on your side, or get up on all fours. If your nether regions are excessively swollen (which often happens if you're been pushing longer than three hours), another position you may want to avoid is squatting, since this increases pressure on the vaginal area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Massage the perineum. By massage, we're not talking about breaking out the coconut oil and New Age music. With perineal massage, a health care provider inserts a finger or two into your vagina and stretches it by pressing toward your anus, typically while you push during contractions. Some women also do perineal massage on themselves (or have their partner help) in the days leading up to delivery. That said, \"Studies have not demonstrated a significant difference in vaginal tearing in women who did perineal massage during pregnancy compared to women who did not, especially for a first vaginal delivery,\" says Dr. Sasan. Still, during your delivery, it definitely pays to ask your health care provider for a hand.\n",
      "Apply a warm compress to the area. It's basic science: Heat causes tissue to expand. And expansion is good when you want to prevent tearing. Studies have shown that a perineal compress can even help prevent deeper third- and fourth-degree tears, with researchers arguing perhaps they should become a standard part of maternal care.\n",
      "Hold off on forceps or the vacuum if possible. While getting a little help in the form of forceps or a vacuum sounds like some welcome relief when you're sick of pushing, try to avoid them as long as your baby is in no danger and you feel you can keep going. The reason: Your body knows best what it can stand. Introducing force from a third party could literally push your nether regions past their breaking point.\n",
      "Refuse an unnecessary episiotomy. In the past, doctors would purposely make an incision in the perineum to enlarge the vaginal opening, which supposedly kept it from tearing more extensively when the baby came out. But no more. \"Doctors are falling away from the trend of routinely performing episiotomies,\" says Dr. Jessica Shepherd, MD, an OB/GYN at Her Viewpoint. While an episiotomy should be performed in certain circumstances, like an abnormally positioned baby or shoulder dystocia (the baby's shoulder blade behind the mother's pubic bone), risk of vaginal tearing should not be one of those reasons ... because honestly now, why cut what isn't broken yet?\n",
      "And if you do tear anyway? \"Even though having a tear in your vagina sounds horrifying, the recovery is quite easy,\" assures Dr. Sasan. Most tears are repaired with absorbable sutures; most of the pain from mild tears fades in two to three weeks, with a full recovery in six weeks (during which time you should avoid intercourse or strenuous exercise). After that, \"for most women you can barely see, if at all, the site of the tear by six weeks,\" she says.\n",

I already do vitamins and im looking to cut meat from our diets and use more organic. But other than that I would like to see a different doctor who might help me fight this without so many drugs. I know the cold is bad for her but unfortunately I can't move so Im going to have to learn to deal with it. Thanks\n",

       "'\"Climate change\" is out. \"Resilience\" is in. \"Victims of domestic violence\" are now \"victims of crime.\" Foreign aid for refugee rights has become aid to protect \"national security.\" \"Clean energy investment\" has been transformed into just plain \"energy\" investment.The federal government is undergoing a rebranding under President Donald Trump - although not all at his direction.As Trump sets new priorities for Washington sharply at odds with what the town has seen for the past eight years, some officials working on hot-button issues such as the environment, nutrition and foreign aid are changing the names of offices and programs that might draw skepticism from the conservative Republican leaders he has installed atop agencies.While entire departments are changing their missions under Trump, many of these rebranding efforts reflect a desire to blend in or escape notice, not a change in what officials do day-to-day - at least not yet, according to 19 current and former employees across the government, and nonprofit officials who receive federal funding.\"I do think it exemplifies a general sense of looking at our programs, looking at the way we characterize our activities, and trying to rebrand or repaint them in ways that hopefully make them less of a target,\" said one Energy Department employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe the changes inside the government.The changes in messaging come as Trump and his Cabinet leaders are setting new priorities - and that will increasingly change the operations of most agencies as time goes on and the administration gets lower-level political appointees into top posts.The Environmental Protection Agency has shifted from enacting climate change regulations to reversing them, while the Energy Department has moved from boosting prospects for renewable energy to promoting President Trump\\'s fossil fuel-focused agenda. The Trump State Department is aiming to cut spending on diplomacy and foreign aid, and the Agriculture Department has backed away from Obama-era rules to ensure healthy school lunches.\"I think you\\'re seeing a combination of people trying to stay below the radar so they don\\'t get whacked, and also trying to morph so they can accommodate what the new administration\\'s point of view is going to be,\" said Adam Cohen, who served as deputy undersecretary for science and energy at the Energy Department from October 2015 until this month.Some of the most striking examples of rebranding come from agencies dealing with energy and the environment, where references to \"climate change\" and \"clean energy\" have sometimes disappeared.In late April, the \"Energy Investor Center\" replaced the Department of Energy\\'s \"Clean Energy Investment Center,\" which was founded in early 2016 to help the private sector better learn how to put money into renewable technologies.Language about the focus on the \"clean and alternative\" energy market vanished from the program\\'s website.The old Web link, which included the word \"clean,\" redirects to one that doesn\\'t, according to an analysis by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, which tracks government website changes affecting the environment.Energy spokeswoman Lindsey Geisler saidthese changes were not ordered by the Trump administration but were made by career staff to \"better reflect the broader focus of the project, which includes all traditional and nontraditional energy sources.\"\"It\\'s our own career staff, they\\'re in their \\'Keep their head down, maybe they won\\'t cut our budget\\' mode,\" said an Energy Department staffer who also spoke anonymously because the employee was not authorized to speak publicly.- - -At two other federal agencies - the EPA and the Federal Highway Administration - programs have shifted to talking about \"resilience\" rather than \"climate change.\"The EPA\\'s \"Climate Ready Water Utilities\" site was renamed \"Creating Resilient Water Utilities\" - even before the inauguration, the timing of which suggests it was unlikely that Trump appointees were involved in the change.At the Federal Highway Administration, a website focused on the environmental impacts of cars and other forms oftransportation replaced a page addressing \"climate change\" with one about \"sustainability\" sometime in January.Another page, on climate change \"adaptation,\" morphed into one titled \"resilience,\" and the overall program, formerly known as the Sustainable Transport and Climate Change group, was renamed the Sustainable Transportation and Resilience group.The rebrandings extend beyond the energy and environment sphere.A key Obama-era initiative at the Agriculture Department called \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food,\" which brought together seven farm-to-table nutrition programs, was moved from the agency\\'s main website to an obscure one within the USDA\\'s Agricultural Marketing Service, where it appears under the blander \"Local & Regional Food Sector.\" Instead of highlighting farmers markets, organic agriculture and a \"Farm to School\" program, the site features \"Opportunities for Farmers and Ranchers\" and guidance on\"Aggregating, Processing and Distributing.\"Development programs, facing potentially drastic funding cuts to international aid, have reframed their missions to de-emphasize Obama-era priorities such as women\\'s health and climate change and instead play up regional stability and religious freedom in areas where Christians are persecuted.\"Civil servants running data-driven initiatives are trying to figure out how to reframe their work to appeal to a White House that has so far taken an ideologically driven \\'Ready, fire, aim\\' approach to understanding many of our federal programs,\" said Daniel Holt, founder of the Washington-based consulting firm Anchorage Partners and USAID\\'s director of public engagement from 2015 to 2017.\"Staff shouldn\\'t feel their jobs are threatened by those who haven\\'t looked into the efficacy of the programs they\\'re going after,\" Holt said. \"These are civil servants who have sworn an oath to faithfully do their jobs in service of our country.\"The rebranding has been made easier by a vacuum in political leadership at most agencies, where five months after Trump was sworn in, Cabinet secretaries have few if any of their senior leaders in place.
